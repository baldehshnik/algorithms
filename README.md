<h2><b>The repository was created for storing code of algorithms.</b></h2>

The repository will store code in two languages: <b>Java</b> and <b>Kotlin</b>.

Implemented algorithms:
 * Sorting:
   * <b>[Bubble Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/ "Bubble Sort â€“ Data Structure and Algorithm Tutorials") (Java).</b>
     Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
     This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.
     <b><h4>Complexity Analysis of Bubble Sort:</h4></b>
     &emsp;<b>Time Complexity:</b> O(N^2)
     </br>&emsp;<b>Auxiliary Space:</b> O(1)
