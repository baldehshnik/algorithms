<h2><b>The repository was created for storing code of algorithms.</b></h2>

The repository will store code in two languages: <b>Java</b> and <b>Kotlin</b>.

Implemented algorithms:
 * Sorting:
   * <b>[Bubble Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/ "Bubble Sort – Data Structure and Algorithm Tutorials") (Java).</b>
     Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
     This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.
     <b><h4>Complexity Analysis of Bubble Sort:</h4></b>
     &emsp;<b>Time Complexity:</b> O(N^2)
     </br>&emsp;<b>Auxiliary Space:</b> O(1)

   * <b>[Insertion Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-sort/ "Insertion Sort – Data Structure and Algorithm Tutorials") (Java).</b>
    Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands.
    The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
    <b><h4>Complexity Analysis of Insertion Sort:</h4></b>
    &emsp;<b>Time Complexity:</b> O(N^2)
    </br>&emsp;<b>Auxiliary Space:</b> O(1)

   * <b>[Selection Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selection-sort/ "Selection Sort – Data Structure and Algorithm Tutorials") (Java).</b>
    Selection sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list
    and moving it to the sorted portion of the list.
    <b><h4>Complexity Analysis of Selection Sort:</h4></b>
    &emsp;<b>Time Complexity:</b> O(N^2)
    </br>&emsp;<b>Auxiliary Space:</b> O(1)

   * <b>[Shuttle (Cocktail) Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cocktail-sort/ "Cocktail Sort") (Java).</b>
    Shuttle (Cocktail) Sort is a variation of Bubble sort. The Bubble sort algorithm always traverses elements from left and
    moves the largest element to its correct position in the first iteration and second-largest in the second iteration and so on.
    Shuttle (Cocktail) Sort traverses through a given array in both directions alternatively.
    <b><h4>Complexity Analysis of Shuttle (Cocktail) Sort:</h4></b>
    &emsp;<b>Time Complexity:</b> O(N^2)
    </br>&emsp;<b>Auxiliary Space:</b> O(1)

   * <b>[Merge Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/ "Merge Sort – Data Structure and Algorithms Tutorials") (Java).</b>
    Merge sort is defined as a sorting algorithm that works by dividing an array into smaller subarrays,
    sorting each subarray, and then merging the sorted subarrays back together to form the final sorted array.
    <b><h4>Complexity Analysis of Merge Sort:</h4></b>
    &emsp;<b>Time Complexity:</b> O(N log(N))
    </br>&emsp;<b>Auxiliary Space:</b> O(N)

 * Search:
   * <b>[Binary Search](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/ "Binary Search – Data Structure and Algorithm Tutorials") (Java).</b>
   Binary Search is defined as a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
   The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(log N).
   <b><h4>Complexity Analysis of Binary Search:</h4></b>
   &emsp;<b>Time Complexity:</b> O(log N)
   </br>&emsp;<b>Auxiliary Space:</b> O(1)
